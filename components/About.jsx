        <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio ðŸ˜Š.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Current tech used: Node, React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I continue to develop my React JS skills and knowledge with the aim of
          working towards creating MERN stack applications - insuring I have the
          ability to be able to create solutions for business problems.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          My interest in web development began during my university days, where
          I built blogs using WordPress.com. Since then, I have worked with
          various Content Management Systems such as Squarespace, WIX, and
          Webflow.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          This sparked my curiosity about the technologies behind those CMS
          platforms and how they functioned. While running a Limited company in
          digital recruitment, I witnessed the immense power and potential of
          web development and the tech industry as a whole.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Inspired by this realisation, I embarked on a self-taught journey to
          become a front-end web developer.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In addition, I am also a qualified and experienced digital marketer -
          which can always come in handy! Thank you for reading.
