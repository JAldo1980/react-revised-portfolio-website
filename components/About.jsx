          Hi, Welcome to my portfolio, where my focus is on delivering tangible
          value to your organisation.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In my continual pursuit of professional development, I actively refine
          my skills in Node, React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. My core objective
          early this year is to craft MERN stack applications, equipping me with
          the capability to provide tailored solutions that address your
          specific business challenges.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical knowledge, I bring a wealth of expertise
          as a qualified and seasoned digital marketer, presenting a valuable
          dual skill set. My commitment is to leverage these skills to enhance
          your business objectives, whether it's through creating engaging user
          interfaces or implementing effective digital marketing strategies. I'm
          enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team's
          success and appreciate your time in considering how my journey aligns
          with your organisation's growth.
        </p>

          My journey into web development began during my university years,
          where I constructed blogs using WordPress.com. This initial experience
          evolved into hands-on proficiency with various Content Management
          Systems like Squarespace and WIX. Fueled by my fascination with the
          technologies powering these platforms and their intricate
          functionalities, I recognised the transformative potential of web
          development within the broader tech industry.

          This awareness deepened during my role as the founder of a Limited
          company specialising in digital recruitment. Witnessing firsthand the
          profound impact of web development and technology on optimising
          business operations ignited my determination to transition into a
          front-end web developer (with additional value adds such as digital
          marketing expereince). Thank you for reading ðŸ˜Š
