        <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio ðŸ˜Š.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Current tech used: <strong>Node, React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML</strong>

          In my ongoing professional development, I am actively honing my
          expertise in Node, React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. My primary
          objective is to advance towards proficiently crafting MERN stack
          applications, ensuring a robust capability to provide effective
          solutions for diverse business challenges.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          My initiation into web development traces back to my university years,
          during which I constructed blogs using WordPress.com. This initial
          exposure evolved into hands-on experience with various Content
          Management Systems, including Squarespace and WIX. Intrigued by the
          underlying technologies powering these CMS platforms and their
          intricate functionalities, I recognised the transformative potential
          of web development and the broader tech industry.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          This realisation became particularly evident during my tenure as the
          founder of a Limited company specialising in digital recruitment.
          Observing firsthand the profound impact of web development and
          technology on business operations fuelled my determination to
          transition into a front-end web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Complementing my technical skills, I bring a wealth of expertise as a
          qualified and seasoned digital marketer, adding a valuable dimension
          to my professional profile. I appreciate your time in considering my
          journey and aspirations. Thank you for reading! ðŸ˜Š
