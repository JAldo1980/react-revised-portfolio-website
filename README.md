# React App Showcase: [Your App Name]

## Overview

This repository showcases a React web application that demonstrates the use of components, props, and data handling.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The application is built using the React library, taking advantage of its component-based architecture.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern JavaScript is used to write the logic for the app.
- **CSS (or SCSS):** Styling is implemented using CSS (or SCSS) to create a visually appealing user interface.

## Features

- **Component-Based Structure:** The app is structured using reusable React components to enhance modularity and maintainability.
- **Props Passing:** Components utilise props to dynamically render content and pass data between parent and child components.
- **Data Handling:** Data stored and pulled locally.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React app.
  - `components/`: Houses all React components.
  - `data/`: Stores static or sample data used in the app.
  - `styles/`: Includes CSS (or SCSS) files for styling.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point of the application.
